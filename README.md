- 👋 Hi, I’m László Stummer.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. Extremely in Java Backend nowadays.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - testing: JUnit, AssertJ, Mockito;
  - Spring Boot framework;
  - Maven;
  - Docker.
- 💞️ I’m searching my new employer who ensure me tasks, where I can do nothing else just coding, coding and coding.
Of course, in collaboration with my teammates.
